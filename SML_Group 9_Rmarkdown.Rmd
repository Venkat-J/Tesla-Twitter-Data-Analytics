## I. Getting the Twitter Data

### Twitter API

  In order to retrieve Twitter data, we needed to first create a developer account from the Twitter platform and extract our personal credentials to create a valid API. Thanks to the "rtweet" package, we were able to extract Tesla's last 3200 tweets using the get_timelines function. We finally saved this database with a ".rds" extension, using the "mgcv" package.

### Handling the Timeline

  The oldest tweets we could get from this database were from 2013. As a result, we decided to subset only the 2019/2020 tweets from this original database. As Tesla's amount of tweets significantly diminishes in 2020, some parts of the analysis focus only on the 2019 tweets, to be able to gather enough data points to conduct a trustworthy analysis. In total, the Teslaâ€™s Twitter Dataset contains 771 Tweets and 97 features, which are leveraged in this analysis for deriving insights.

## III. Overall Summary of Tesla's Tweets

  Tesla has an overall volume of 771 Tweets with 73,98,637 followers, 6,48,332 Retweets and 57,99,519 Favourites.
  
### Twitter Engagement Rate

  The twitter engagement rate is calculated based on the retweets, favourites, quotes, replies and followers count.
  
  The average Twitter engagement rate of Tesla is 0.11%. Tesla has a huge scope in increasing its twitter engagement rate by increasing its reply and quote counts.

### Directed Vs Un-Directed Tweets

  Based on the Teslaâ€™s Twitter posts, it posts Directed Tweets slightly higher than the Un-Directed posts.

``` {r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning= FALSE}

# Converting any NA value to 0

tesla_tweets$retweet_count[is.na(tesla_tweets$retweet_count)]   <- 0
tesla_tweets$favorite_count[is.na(tesla_tweets$favorite_count)] <- 0
tesla_tweets$quote_count[is.na(tesla_tweets$quote_count)]       <- 0
tesla_tweets$reply_count[is.na(tesla_tweets$reply_count)]       <- 0

# Calculating the Number of directed or undirected tweets

Directed     <- sum(grepl('@', tesla_tweets$text) | grepl('#', tesla_tweets$text))
Non_Directed <- nrow(tesla_tweets) - Directed

Directed_Percent     <- round((Directed/nrow(tesla_tweets))*100)
Non_Directed_Percent <- round((Non_Directed/nrow(tesla_tweets))*100)

# Creating Pie-Chart for Directed and Non-Directed Tweets

#create data frame
data <- data.frame("Tweets" = c('Directed Tweets', 'Non Directed Tweets'),
                   "Amount"   = c(Directed, Non_Directed))

Percent <- c(Directed_Percent, Non_Directed_Percent)

#create pie chart
ggplot(data, aes(x="", y=Amount, fill=Tweets)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", width=1) +
  coord_polar("y", start=0) +
  geom_text(aes(label = (paste0(Percent, "%"))), position = position_stack(vjust=0.5)) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, fill = NULL) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.line = element_blank(),
          axis.text = element_blank(),
          axis.ticks = element_blank()) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="BuGn")


```
### Number of Tweets over Time

  Tesla posted a maximum number of tweets in the month of April 2019.
  
``` {r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning= FALSE}

# Creating Time-Series graph for the frequency of tweets by Tesla

ts_plot(tesla_tweets, by = "months", trim = 0L, tz = "UTC")

# Number of tweets posted reached it's maximum around April 2019
  
```

### Tweets Type Distribution

  Tesla's approach to releasing tweets is interesting as it uses only 37% of organic tweets. However, for example, when looking at the SpaceX twitter account, which is a company also directed by Elon Musk, the organic tweets represent more than 75% of the tweeting strategy.

``` {r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning= FALSE}

# Keeping only the retweets
tesla_retweets <- tesla_tweets[tesla_tweets$is_retweet==TRUE,]

# Keeping only the replies
tesla_replies <- subset(tesla_tweets, !is.na(tesla_tweets$reply_to_status_id))

# Keeping only the organic tweets
tesla_tweets_organic <- tesla_tweets[tesla_tweets$is_retweet==FALSE, ] 
tesla_tweets_organic <- subset(tesla_tweets_organic, is.na(tesla_tweets_organic$reply_to_status_id))

# Creating a data frame to create a graph
data <- data.frame(
  category=c("Organic", "Retweets", "Replies"),
  count=c(282, 78, 411)
)

# Adding columns with counts and fractions of tweets types
data$fraction = data$count / sum(data$count)
data$percentage = data$count / sum(data$count) * 100
data$ymax = cumsum(data$fraction)
data$ymin = c(0, head(data$ymax, n=-1))

# Function to round
round_df <- function(df, digits) {
  nums <- vapply(df, is.numeric, FUN.VALUE = logical(1))

  df[,nums] <- round(df[,nums], digits = digits)

  (df)
}

# Rounding the data to two decimal points
data <- round_df(data, 2)

# Specify what the legend should say
Type_of_Tweet <- paste(data$category, data$percentage, "%")
ggplot(data, aes(ymax=ymax, ymin=ymin, xmax=4, xmin=3, fill=Type_of_Tweet)) +
  geom_rect() +
  coord_polar(theta="y") + 
  xlim(c(2, 4)) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "right")
  
```

### Tweets Source

  Using the "source" variable of the dataset, we are able to understand where the tweets are deployed from. Predominantly, the tweets are released from the "Twitter Web Client" platform, but is it interesting to note that 10% of the tweets are coming from an Apple phone, which could imply that Elon Musk is tweeting 10% of the tweets himself.
  
``` {r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning= FALSE}

## Tweets location
tesla_app <- tesla_tweets %>% 
  select(source) %>% 
  group_by(source) %>%
  summarize(count=n())

tesla_app <- subset(tesla_app, count > 11)

  
## Creating a dataframe with source and count of tweets per source
data <- data.frame(
  category=tesla_app$source,
  count=tesla_app$count
)
data$fraction = data$count / sum(data$count)
data$percentage = data$count / sum(data$count) * 100
data$ymax = cumsum(data$fraction)
data$ymin = c(0, head(data$ymax, n=-1))
data <- round_df(data, 2)
Source <- paste(data$category, data$percentage, "%")
ggplot(data, aes(ymax=ymax, ymin=ymin, xmax=4, xmin=3, fill=Source)) +
  geom_rect() +
  coord_polar(theta="y") + # Try to remove that to understand how the chart is built initially
  xlim(c(2, 4)) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "right")
```


### Tweets Frequency (2019)

  Tesla is tweeting on average 3 tweets per day. However, the number of tweets can significantly vary according to the month or the day of the week we are considering.
  
  This frequency analysis focuses on tweets released in 2019, as the count of 2020 tweets are rather low.
    
#### By Month

  labs(title= "Distribution of tweets per hour of the day and day of the week in 2019",
       y="day of the week", x = "hour of the day")

```

### Use of Emojis (2019)

  Tesla uses very few emojis in its tweets. However, the emojis that they use are diverse and quite male connoted.

tesla_least_favourites <- tesla_tweets_organic %>% arrange(favorite_count)
tesla_least_favourites[1:5,5]

  Below are the 5 tweets that have been retweeted the least.
  
``` {r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning= FALSE}

# least retweets
tesla_least_retweets <- tesla_tweets_organic %>% arrange(retweet_count)
tesla_least_retweets[1:5,5]
```

  Here, we can picture the number of favorites over time.
  
``` {r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning= FALSE}

# number of favourites per tweets per month in 2019
favourites_plot <- tesla_tweets_2019 %>% group_by(month) %>% summarize(count = sum(favorite_count))

# plotting
ggplot(favourites_plot, aes(y=count, x=month)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width=0.5) +
  geom_text(aes(label=paste(round(count/5066025*100,1),"%",sep="")),vjust=-1, col="red", size=2.5) +
  labs(title= "Distribution of favorites per month in 2019",
       y="month", x = "number of favorites")

```

### Use of Images in Tweets

  Tesla is using only the 'photo' type of media in their tweets. There is no presence of video or gifs.
  
  Over the year 2019, the company used 92 images, which represents approximately 12% of its tweets.
  
``` {r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning= FALSE}
# type of media used
unique(tesla_tweets_2019$media_type)
```
  This graph informs us on how Tesla uses images in tweets over the year 2019. We can conclude a certian seasonality in car sales, which we have confirmed by searching on the Internet. The peak seasons for the automobile industry are situated in the late srping and November.  The use of images in September tells us that Tesla was surely communicating on their models at that time.
  
``` {r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning= FALSE}
# number of tweets with images per month
images_usage_plot <- tesla_tweets_2019 %>% filter(!is.na(media_url)) %>% group_by(month) %>% summarize(count = n())

# plotting
ggplot(images_usage_plot, aes(y=count, x=month)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width=0.5) +
  geom_text(aes(label=paste(round(count/92*100,1),"%",sep="")),vjust=-1, col="red", size=2.5) +
  labs(title= "Distribution of images per month in 2019",
       y="month", x = "number of images used")
```

## V. Sentiment Analysis

  The main goal of this section is to conduct a sentiment analysis on the contents of Tesla's tweets, in order to extract a clear idea of the emotion associated to tweets from Tesla and its evolution over time.
  
  To do so, it is of course necessary to clean the data and preprocess the content.

  The first step is the removal of punctuation, of symbols and of numbers. At this point what we did was to tokenize all the text for further steps, such as stemming and lemmatization. 

  
``` {r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning= FALSE}

# Removing punctutation, symbols, numbers
tesla_tweets <- mutate(tesla_tweets, text = gsub(x = text, pattern = "[0-9]+|[[:punct:]]|\\(.*\\)", replacement = ""))
head(tesla_tweets$text)

# tokenisation
tesla_tweets_tokenized <- tesla_tweets %>% unnest_tokens(output = "word", input = text, token ="words", drop = FALSE, to_lower = TRUE)
tesla_tweets_tokenized[1:5,c(1,2,5,98)]

```

  After the cleaning, we proceeded with the join of the tokenized words with the BING dictionary, in order to get a sentiment to them.
  
``` {r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning= FALSE}

# correcting the spelling with a function

correct_spelling <- function(input) {
  output <- case_when(
    # any manual corrections
    input == 'license' ~ 'licence',
    # check and (if required) correct spelling
    !hunspell_check(input, dictionary('en_GB')) ~
      hunspell_suggest(input, dictionary('en_GB')) %>%
      # get first suggestion, or NA if suggestions list is empty
      map(1, .default = NA) %>%
      unlist(),
    TRUE ~ input # if word is correct
  )
  # if input incorrectly spelled but no suggestions, return input word
  ifelse(is.na(output), input, output)
}

# now, apply the function above to each word in our dataset.
# create a new variable that contains the 'corrected' word
tesla_tweets_tokenized <- tesla_tweets_tokenized %>%  mutate(suggestion = correct_spelling(word))

#we want to tokenize and delete the stopwords
tesla_tweets_tokenized <- tesla_tweets_tokenized %>% anti_join(get_stopwords())

# stemming
tesla_tweets_tokenized <- tesla_tweets_tokenized %>% mutate(word = wordStem(word))

#for the scope of this analysis we limited the dictionary usage to the BING one.
tesla_tweets_sentiment<- inner_join(tesla_tweets_tokenized, get_sentiments("bing"))

tesla_tweets_sentiment[1:5,c(1,2,5,98,99,100)]
```

### Words Frequency and Sentiment

  Then we decided to plot the summary of the words, and of their sentiment of course, in order to understand how much they were used.
  
  So as we can see from the plot, positive words are much more used than negative ones. Positive concepts used here are "freedom", "being better", "being the best", "good - great", while the most recurring negative ones are recalling "weird products", "crashes", "burning and combustible".

``` {r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning= FALSE}

#here we want to get a plot of the summary of the most used words and their meaning

#get the most positive / negative words 
summarySentiment <- tesla_tweets_sentiment %>% count(word, sentiment, sort = TRUE) %>% group_by(sentiment) %>% top_n(10) %>% arrange(n) %>% as.data.frame(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

summarySentiment %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(word, n, fill = sentiment)) + 
    geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
    facet_wrap(~sentiment, scales = "free_y") +
    labs(y="Contribution to sentiment", x = NULL) + coord_flip()

```

  Finally, we obtained a summary sentiment for each tweet, so to get a clear emotion associated to a tweet, taking in consideration the overall positive and negative sentiments recalled in the text.

``` {r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning= FALSE}

statusSentiment <- tesla_tweets_sentiment %>% count(status_id, sentiment) %>% pivot_wider(id_cols = status_id, names_from = sentiment, values_from = n, values_fill = 0) %>% mutate(sentiment = positive - negative)

head(statusSentiment)

```

### Sentiment over Time

  We decided to plot the evolution of sentiment overtime.
  
  From this we can see that the most positive tweets were made in September - Novembre 2019, not randomly, as it is the period of time known for the presentation of the Tesla Cybertruck, which went viral for the level of innovation and risk that it represented for the Company.

  This sentiment analysis has quite limited insights and takeaways as, being a Company page, tweets are most of the times neutral or slightly positive, but they don't really include many negative emotions or strong sentiment at all.

  
``` {r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning= FALSE}

prova <- intersect(statusSentiment$status_id, tesla_tweets_sentiment$status_id)

support_time <- tesla_tweets_sentiment[tesla_tweets_sentiment$status_id %in% prova, ]

#We tried to exclude the tweets for which we didn't obtained a strong sentiment expression
uneeded <- which(!rownames(support_time) %in% rownames(statusSentiment))

#wait for the line below to check whether it was necessary
environment2 <- support_time[-uneeded,]

#as we want to get a plot of the sentiment over time, we need to convert the dates  
statusSentiment$time <- as.POSIXct(environment2$created_at, format ="%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S", tz = "UTC")

#we re subset to make sure to just have tweets from January 2019
statusSentiment_graph <- subset(statusSentiment, time > '2019-01-01')

# plotting the sentiments over time
graph1 <- ggplot(statusSentiment_graph %>% arrange(time), aes(x = time, y = sentiment)) + geom_line() + labs(y="Valence", x = "Time", title ="Sentiment")

graph1

```

## VI. Concept Analysis

### Main Concepts

  We decided to keep the concept analysis simple and effective. For this we decided to implement wordclouds in order to extract just the main ideas that are most frequently evocated in the tweets in analysis.
  
  We did so through the usage of Lemmas and cooccurrences. First with single words:
  
#### 1 word

``` {r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning= FALSE}

#we want to obtain some wordclouds to better understand which are the most recurrent concepts in Tesla's Tweets
ud_model <- udpipe_download_model(language="english")
ud_model <- udpipe_load_model(ud_model$file_model)

x <- udpipe_annotate(ud_model, x = tesla_tweets$text)
x <- as.data.frame(x)

stats <- subset(x, upos %in% c("NOUN", "ADJ"))
stats <- txt_freq(x = stats$lemma)

#with one word
options(warn=-1)
wordcloud(stats$key, stats$freq, max.words= 40, scale = c(3,1))

```

#### Co-occurences

``` {r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning= FALSE}

cooc <- cooccurrence(x= x$lemma, relevant = x$upos %in% c("NOUN", "ADJ"), skipgram = 2)


#with 2 words
options(warn =-1)
wordcloud(paste(cooc$term1, cooc$term2), cooc$cooc, max.words=40, scale = c(3,1))

```

### Limits

**Research and brainstorm about possible solutions / packages:**

1)	Collection of Historical Tweets

â€¢	Initially, utilized search_fullarchive() function in the rtweet package to collect all the historical tweets of Tesla from the year 2019 to 2020.
â€¢	Faced difficulty in extracting the same as this is a Premium API option.
â€¢	After discussion, found an alternate solution and managed to extract the tweets through get_timelines() function in rtweet package, which could collect a maximum of 3200 tweets.
â€¢	We then subset this dataset from 2019 to 2021 to get the desired dataset.

2)	Library Selection for Sentiment Analysis

â€¢	At first, planned to perform the Sentiment Analysis using the AFINN dictionary, which represents the sentiments in the range of -5 to +5.
â€¢	Experienced technically difficulty in loading the text_data package (AFINN dictionary) inside the CoCalc environment.
â€¢	Resolved this issue by performing the sentiment analysis in RStudio and also extended this analysis using the Bing dictionary.
â€¢	Compared the results of both dictionaries and found that there is no significant difference.
â€¢	Finally, as the end results were not compromised, utilized the Bing dictionary to perform the Sentiment Analysis in the CoCalc environment itself.
